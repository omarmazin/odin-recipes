    <h4>
        These savory-sweet shrimp skewers are easy to make<br> and cook in just a few minutes. They are perfect for
        summer
        weeknights or weekend dinner parties.<br> Prep the sauce ahead of time for an even faster dinner. I prefer to
        use
        jumbo shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), however use what you have on hand.

    <h3>Here's what you need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 pound jumbo shrimp</li>
        <li>½ fresh pineapple, cored and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>skewers</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>
        1- Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and ginger in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over
        medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly, 8 to 10
        minutes.
        <br>
        2- Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately
        onto skewers and place on a platter.
        <br>
        3- Arrange skewers on the hot grate. Grill 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until shrimp is opaque and cooked through.
        Turn grill to low heat and brush sauce on both sides of skewers. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with
        cilantro and sesame seeds.
